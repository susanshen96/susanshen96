PENDING EDITS/SUGGESTIONS: 

MENU
1. Blue bar - making it only exists when the mouse is hoving over?  
3. (and SIGNUP as well?)
4. SEARCH BAR 

LOGIN 
1. Login button does not have link because previous 
"menu a" code interfering with individual function 
2. Add stuff to login.html   

CONVERTED FROM BYOB3/CONVERTED FROM SCRATCH  
1. Each individual project should be displayed as follows:
	a. Gray container (adjust size b/c right now it looks 
	weird, since h2 has been change so that the font isn't 
	squished)
	b. Font weird (see a.)
	d. Creator 
2. Changing the blue button to blue outline/white inside 

FOOTER
1. Copyright - there's commented-out code in the HTML as a kinda outline (No CSS yet b/c not sure whether to make a <h6> or use something else)
